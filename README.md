# Code Review Activity

This repository contains a modified code sample from Sendwave's actual codebase. Please **submit a code review, including suggestions for improving code quality.** Assume your "audience" for this code review is a less experienced engineer; try to communicate your feedback clearly and compassionately.

You may also reference the [Address model definition ](https://github.com/waveremit/code-review-activity/blob/master/src/models/address.py) for context.

This activity should take about **30 minutes.**
